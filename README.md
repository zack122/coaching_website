# Libor Hroza Coaching Website - README

## Overview

This project is a web-based platform for Libor Hroza, the head coach of Team Canada for climbing, designed to showcase his coaching services and provide a tailored training experience for athletes. Built using **TypeScript** and **Node.js**, the website will serve both as a portfolio for Libor's coaching career and a tool to help climbers create custom training plans based on their specific inputs and goals.

## Current Status

Progress is underway, with some sections awaiting additional content and input from Libor Hroza. The core feature of the website—the training plan generator—will be built using a template system that adapts based on the athlete’s needs and preferences. As of now, the primary structure and backend development have begun, and features are being scoped.

## Expected Features

1. **Portfolio Section**  
   - Information about Libor Hroza's background, achievements, and coaching philosophy.
   - Testimonials and success stories from athletes he has trained.
   - A media gallery showcasing photos and videos from competitions, training sessions, and coaching.

2. **Training Plan Generator**  
   - A dynamic form where users (athletes) input their personal data (e.g., skill level, goals, timeline).
   - Template-based training plans that adapt based on user inputs, covering areas such as speed climbing techniques, physical conditioning, and mental preparation.
   - Export and download functionality for personalized training plans.
   - Option to book follow-up sessions or consultations with Libor.

3. **Contact and Booking**  
   - A contact form for inquiries regarding coaching services.
   - Calendar integration to book training sessions with Libor.
   - A section for requesting custom training plans or 1-on-1 coaching.

4. **Blog or News Updates**  
   - A blog section where Libor can share climbing tips, training advice, or updates about his athletes' achievements and the climbing world.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:  
  - TypeScript
  - **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and customizable styling
  - HTML/CSS for responsive and user-friendly design
  - Template engine (to be decided) for the training plan forms
  - Potential integration with third-party APIs for additional functionality (e.g., Google Calendar for bookings)

- **Backend**:  
  - Node.js
